# Blaze-it

Simple imitation of [woop-frontend](https://github.com/iterate/woop-frontend).

This is part of my [Firebase workshop](https://github.com/arnemahl/firebase-workshop), and uses the same App setup.

# Lesson

Set up a Firebase app with hosting and authentication, and decide on a database structure and implement the database API-calls in order to:

* Write
    * Create new posts
        * With content, author, and ServerValue.TIMESTAMP
    * Write comments on posts
        * With content, author, and ServerValue.TIMESTAMP
    * Like posts
* Read
    * Get realtime updates of posts, comments and likes
